# Strut-and-Tie Modelling
This repository contains a python-based project for the design with strut-and-tie models and concentrated stress fields for reinforced concrete structures. It includes the evaluation of hydrostatic nodal zones for stress fields. The user should be familiar with these design methods and the responsibility of the results lies with the user.

The current version is 0.3. It includes the validation of strut-and-tie models and the evaluation of hydrostatic nodal zones for stress fields with concentrated struts and ties. For the hydrostatic nodal zones the same center of forces as for the corresponding strut-and-tie models are assumed. Each tie is fully anchored at the nodes. If there are more than three edges acting at one node, then two cases are differentiated. If two ties lie on one plane then the smaller one is removed (as they balance each other out). Otherwise, two edges with the lowest inbetween angle are replaced through one statically equivalent strut.
Furthermore, a simple GUI has been implemented to provide an interactive tool for users. However, it is in a preliminary stage and multiple smaller functions have not yet been implemented yet (e.g. remove node or edge). The main function of validating strut-and-tie models and evaluating the with concentrated stress fields works.

## Getting started
* For required python packages, please check out the requirements file.
* Please check out the following two example jupyter notebook files: stm_example_simple_beam.ipynb with the example of a simple beam incl. how a truss can be assembled, a strut-and-tie model be validated and to check the stress fields and nodal zones. The second example stm_example_deb.ipynb is of a dapped-end beam.

## Getting started with GUI
* Make sure you have installed PyQt6
* In your command-line interface navigate to the folder src, containing the python file stm_gui.py. Run it to access the GUI.
